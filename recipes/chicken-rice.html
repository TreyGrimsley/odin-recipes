<p>Now I will take you throught the steps neccessary to complete the dish!</p>
    <p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
       <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <li>Stir Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Season pounded chicken with blended seasonings, and set aside. </li>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat, and add 1 tablespoon butter.  </li> 
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <li>When butter is melted and oil is hot, cook shallot and mushrooms for about 3 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove from the skillet and keep warm. </li> 
         <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
        <li>To the same skillet, add remaining tablespoon each of oil and butter. When butter is melted and no longer sizzling, carefully add chicken and cook until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. </li> 
        <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
        <li>Turn chicken over, and slowly add dry sherry. Cook about 2 minutes, to allow the alcohol to cook off. </li> 
        <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
        <li>Add chicken stock, mushroom-shallot mixture, thyme sprigs, and 2 tablespoons parsley to the pan. Bring to a boil and stir in rice. Lift chicken so that it rests on top of the rice and vegetables. Cover, reduce heat, and cook for about 15 minutes. </li> 
        <p><strong> Step 7</strong></p>
        <li>Stir in peas, and stir rice from the edges of the pan into the center. Taste and season with salt and pepper, and cook until rice is tender, chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, about 5 minutes more. Remove pan from heat, and allow to stand, covered, about 5 minutes. An instant read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li> 
        <p><strong>Step 8</strong></p>
        <li>Remove thyme sprigs, fluff rice with a fork, and garnish with reserved fresh minced parsley. </li> 
        <p><strong>Step 9</strong></p>
        <li>Serve and enjoy! </li>
